by Ryan Switzer

## Software Requirements
* Python2.7
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV

## Overview
Basic computer vision implementations.
* bip.py: Basic image processing script that performs equalization
* ced.py: Rudimentary personal implementation of canny edge detection (i.e. lacks optimization)
* dice.py: Image processing pipeline that deciphers the # of dice and their total face value
* seg.py: Image segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm
